### Introduction
##### 01 - What's your Superpower?

> Removing online technology didn't work. I'd just replace one distraction with another

Living the life we want requires not only ***doing the right things***, it also requires us to ***stop doing the wrong things***

&nbsp
##### 02 - Being Indistractable

Tantalus is cursed to always yearn and never get it.

- Traction means to pull or drag
- Distraction means drawing away

Tractions are actions that moves us towards what we want
Distractions are actions that moves us away from what we want

> The wealth of information means the dearth of something else... a poverty of attention

==**Indistractable means striving to do what you say you will do. Indistractable people are as honest with themselves as they are with the others**==


**Four-part Indistractable model:**
- Master Internal Triggers
- Hack back External Triggers
- Prevent distraction with pacts
- Make time for traction

### Part-1 : Master Internal Triggers
##### 03 - What motivates us really?
> Even when we think we're seeking pleasure, we're actually driven the desire to free ourselves from the pain of wanting

By pleasure, we mean the absense of pain in the body and of the trouble in the soul.

Proximate causes - help us deflect responsibility onto someone or something else (blame)

We tend to blame things like tv, phones, junk food, video games - these are proximate causes of our distration. 
Unless we deal with the root cause of our distractions, we will always find ways to distract ourselves.

**Proximate causes(distractions) are an unhealthy escape from reality**.

> Only be understanding our pain can we begin to control it and find better ways to deal with negative urges.

==**Understand the root cause of distraction**==

&nbsp
##### 04 - Time management is pain management
Distraction is just another way in which our brains attempt to deal with pain. 
**==The only way to handle distraction is by learning to handle discomfort.==**

> If distraction costs us time, then time management is pain management.

Four psychological factors make satisfaction temporary:

BOREDOM - People prefer doing to thinking. The untutored mind does not like to be alone with itself.

NEGATIVITY BIAS - We tend to have an easier time recalling bad memories than happier ones.

RUMINATION - Our tendency to keep thinking about bad experiences.

HEDONIC ADAPTATION - The tendency to return quickly to baseline satisfaction no matter what happens to us in life. Every desirable experience - passionate love, a spiritual high, pleasure of new possession, success - is transitory.

> Dissatisfaction and discomfort dominate our brain's default state, but we can use them to motivate us instead of defeat us.

> Its good to know that feeling bad isn't actually bad; it's exactly what survival of the fittest intended

&nbsp
##### 05 - Deal with distraction from within

**Why not deal with the urges ourselves? Why not just say no?**

> Mental abstinence can backfire

==Suppressing desires or distractions will only lead to **rebound**
to distractions more prominently than before.==

&nbsp
##### 06 - Reimagine the internal trigger

> While we can't control the thoughts or feelings that pop into our heads, we can control what we do with them.

Rather than trying to fight the urge, we need new methods to cope with them.

**Step-1**  
	Look for the discomfort that precedes the distraction, focusing in on the internal trigger.  

**Step-2**  
	Write down the trigger.

Note the time of the day, what you were doing and how you felt when you noticed the internal trigger.  

**It takes some time and trial to notice and understand the internal triggers.**  
Discuss about the trigger with yourself, as an observer.

**Step-3**
	Explore your sensations.  

Do you get a flurry of butterflies when you think about work or studying. ==**Think about the sensation and feel it before acting on the impulse.**==

> When feeling the uncomfortable internal trigger to do something you'd rather not, imagine you are seated beside a gently flowing stream. Then imagine there are leaves floating down that stream. Place each thought in your mind on each leaf. It could be a memory, a word,a worry, a image. And let each of those leaves float down that stream, swirling away, as you sit and just watch.

**Step-4** 
	==**Beware of liminal moments.**==  

Liminal moments are the transition from one thing to the other throughout the day.

**Have you looked at a social media app while walking from one room to the next, only to keep scrolling when you get back to your desk. By ==doing them just for a second== we're likely to do things we might regret later, like getting off-track for half an hour or more.**

###### **Ten Minute Rule**
> If you find yourself wanting to look at your phone, tell yourself it's fine to check it, but not right now. Tell yourself to wait for 10 minutes before checking your phone.  

The ten minute rule helps you to *surf the urge*.
When an urge takes hold, noticing the sensations and riding them like a wave - neither pushing them away nor acting on them - helps us cope until the feeling subside.

**By the end of ten minutes, the liminal moment would have passed and would be able to things that we really want to do.**

&nbsp
##### 07 - Reimagine the task
> [quote] Fun turns out to be fun even if it doesn't involve much (or any) enjoyment  
>                                         - *Play Anything*, Dr. Bogost

**Fun and play don't have to make us feel good per se; rather they can be used as tools to keep us focused.**

**==Operating under constraints is the key to creativity and fun.==**

Fun is looking for the variability in something other people don't notice. It's breaking through the boredom and monotony to discover it's hidden beauty.  

**==Finding novelty is only possible when we give ourselves the time to focus intently on a task and look hard for the variability.==**

Play doesn't have to be pleasurable. It just has to hold our attentions.

&nbsp
##### 08 - Reimagine your Temparament
To manage the discomfort that tugs us towards distraction, we need to think of ourselves differently.  
It is a ***myth*** that our self-control is limited. We think that we are liable to run out of willpower when we exert ourselves. Psychologists have named this phenomenon ***ego-depletion***.  

**Ego depletion were observed only in test subjects who believed willpower is a limited resource.**

**==Willpower is not a limited resource==**

Thinking you need a break when doing a difficult task is counter-productive. Rather we have to think that lack of motivation is temporary.

**==Mindset matters. What we say to ourself is vitally important. Think that your willpower is stronger than your craving.==**

**==Labelling yourself as having less self-control actually leads to less self control.==**

People who are more self-compassionate have a greater sense of wellbeing.

> Self-compassion makes people more resilient to letdowns. If you find yourself listening to the little voice in your head that sometimes bullies you around, it's important to know how to respond.  
> Instead of accepting what the voice says or arguing with it, remind yourself that obstacles are part of the process of growth. 

***Practice self-compassion.***  
***You are powerless, only if you think you are***
